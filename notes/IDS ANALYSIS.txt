TO GENERATE AN ID ANALYSIS:


Run the auto_capture_ids.sh until you've gathered as much data as youd like to test, than kill the terminal.

run parser.py with your file_names and value_id files and watch for a tainted print (this shouldn't take long for reasonably sized loads)



3/6/20:

First test, by hand, 5 files all matched by preliminary parser file

Run sh script for several hours overnight.

3/7/20:

arrived in morning, ran parser, no tainted files!

For extra testing security, I'm restarting the nuc and reconnecting the aeotech device to determine if there is ID discrepency between days.

** THIS ABOVE CAUSED THREE TAINTED DICTIONARIES! LEFT THIS SET IN FOLDER FOR MANUAL ANALYSIS (could be a fluke?)

Tested again with no restarts and am finding discrepencies. Feel free to cross check.
